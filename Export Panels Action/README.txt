This package provides automated actions to streamline the creation and export of seamless Instagram carousel posts.

ATN File:
Instagram Carousel Export.atn - Photoshop action file

Installation & Usage

Templates: Open the desired .psd template file in Photoshop. Design each panel of your carousel within the provided guides.
Actions:
Install:
Double-click each .atn file to automatically load it into Photoshop's Actions panel.
Alternatively, in Photoshop go to Window > Actions. In the Actions panel menu, select Load Actions... and choose the .atn files.
Use:
In your designed PSD, select the appropriate action (e.g., "IG Carousel Export 5 Panels") from the Actions panel.
Click the "Play" button at the bottom of the Actions panel to automatically export each panel as a correctly sized image file.
Important Notes:

File Naming: The exported image files will follow a sequential naming convention (e.g., IG-Panel-1.jpeg, IG-Panel-2.jpeg, etc.).
Output Folder: Exported images are typically saved to the same directory as your PSD file.
Image Format: By default, the actions export as JPEG. You can modify the action settings if you prefer a different format (like PNG).
Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues, ensure your Photoshop version is up-to-date and that you've correctly loaded the actions.
Example Workflow:

Open 4-Panels.psd.
Design your carousel across the four panels.
In the Actions panel, select "IG Carousel Export 4 Panels".
Click "Play". Photoshop will create four perfectly sized images ready for Instagram.
Tips:

Design Cohesively: Plan your carousel design so that it flows seamlessly from one panel to the next.
Test on Mobile: Preview your carousel on a mobile device to ensure it looks as intended.
Experiment: Have fun creating engaging and visually appealing carousels!
